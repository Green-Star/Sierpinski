==========

This project is a funny contest with [Gwillald](https://github.com/Gwillald) and [kaldoran](https://github.com/kaldoran) where we need to implement the fastest [Sierpinsky carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet) creation program.

        image_name:       path to the outputed image
        iterations:       number of iterations for the Sierpinksi carpet
        size:             size of the image, a power of 3 for an optimal result
        background_color: color for the background pixels, in hexadecimal (white by default)
